# Origin of life

1. In nature, stable structures tend to have greater longevity. We observe that they persist over time. However, if these stable structures also possess the capability to move and replicate, they are better able to endure across both space and time.
2. Initially, certain molecules with the capability to replicate themselves emerged by chance. These molecules are referred to as replicators.
3. Replication was not perfect, leading to occasional errors. These errors resulted in variations among replicators, influencing their replication efficiency either positively or negatively.
4. Replicators that survived longer, could replicate faster, and made fewer errors were more likely to persist and dominate in their environment.
5. The specific structure of each replicator molecule influenced the formation of various structures and mechanisms. Replicators that developed structures enhancing their replication capabilities became more prevalent, further driving the evolutionary process.
6. These early replicators are the precursors to modern genes. Over time, they formed increasingly complex associations and structures, eventually giving rise to the first cellular organisms.
7. Eventually, the replicators grouped, forming complex structures that evolved into all forms of life, including humans.
