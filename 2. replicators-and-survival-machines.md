# Replicators and survival machines

1. The structure of the replicator molecule dictates the configuration of the protective container it inhabits, i.e. the body.
2. Replicators that form containers best suited for survival and reproduction are more likely to prevail.
3. Through evolution, they improved mechanisms to -
    1. Protect themselves from nature.
    2. Gain the energy needed for mechanisms in the body.
    3. Protect themselves from peers and other organisms.
    4. Reproduce better.
4. As a result, we developed senses, feelings, memory, intelligence, and communication.
