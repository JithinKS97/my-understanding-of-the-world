# Origin of sense organs
1. Survival machines rely on natural phenomena such as light, sound, airborne molecules, and direct contact to perceive their external environment.
2. Initially, simple cells evolved sensitivity to these stimuli. Over time, these cells specialized and developed into more complex sensory organs like the skin, eyes, ears, tongue, and nose.
3. These sensory organs evolved in ways that best suited the survival and reproductive needs of the organisms within their specific environments.
