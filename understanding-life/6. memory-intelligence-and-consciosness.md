# Memory, intelligence and consciousness

1. To survive and reproduce, a survival machine needs to do certain actions in certain situations in an optimal way.
2. One effective strategy is to remember past situations and respond based on them.
3. This capability led to the emergence of primitive forms of memory eventually evolving into short-term and long-term memories.
4. Additionally, the ability to construct a simplified mental model of the world, simulate different outcomes, and select the optimal one. This is what thinking is.
5. An organism that can create a mental model of its environment and envision itself within this model is considered conscious.
6. Such an organism can also predict the actions of others and strategically choose the best response.
7. Its ability to interpret the sounds and body language of other organisms further enhances its survival strategies.
8. An organism that performs these cognitive processes most effectively is regarded as highly intelligent.
