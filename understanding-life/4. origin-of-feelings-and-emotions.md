# Origin of feelings and emotions

1. Survival machines need to move and manipulate objects with their appendages to survive and reproduce.
2. They must be able to interpret the intentions and actions of other organisms.
3. They must escape from natural dangers and dangerous actions of other organisms.
4. They must seek objects and mates that improve their survival and reproduction chances.
5. This involves not just moving around but also using their limbs to interact with the environment and communicating through sounds.
6. An internal drive motivates them to perform these necessary actions.
7. As a result, they experience a wide range of emotions and feelings, including pain, fear, surprise, enjoyment, happiness, sadness, love, humor, anger, disgust, curiosity, loneliness, anxiety, relief, pride, shame, gratitude, jealousy, empathy, anticipation, and remorse.
8. These emotions and feelings prompt actions that improve their chances of survival and successful reproduction.
