# Origin of feelings and emotions

1. Survival machines must seek objects and mates that improve their survival and reproduction chances.
2. They must escape from natural dangers and the dangerous actions of other organisms.
4. For this, they need to move around, make sound, and light, and manipulate objects with their appendages to survive and reproduce.
7. There should be an internal drive that motivates them to perform these necessary actions.
8. So, they experience a wide range of emotions and feelings, including pain, fear, surprise, enjoyment, happiness, sadness, love, humor, anger, disgust, curiosity, loneliness, anxiety, relief, pride, shame, gratitude, jealousy, empathy, anticipation, and remorse.
9. These emotions and feelings prompt actions that improve their chances of survival and successful reproduction.
