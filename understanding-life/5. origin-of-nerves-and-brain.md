# Origin of Nerves and Brain

1. Signals from sensory organs are interpreted by processing centers, which then generate appropriate responses for movement.
2. Initially, simple neural circuits were formed to handle this signal interpretation and response.
3. Over time, these circuits grew increasingly complex, eventually giving rise to the development of the brain.
