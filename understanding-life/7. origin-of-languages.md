# Origin of Languages

1. Humans communicate complex ideas through intricate sound patterns, which has enhanced their ability to create detailed models and simulations of the world.
2. Over time, they began using symbols as a means to communicate, record information, and preserve knowledge.
3. This advancement in communication allowed groups of humans to collaboratively manipulate natural forces and develop the technologies that underpin modern society.
4. A specific form of symbol manipulation called mathematics was invented, that allowed them to very precisely model the world and that gave them the ability to manipulate nature's force in precise ways.
