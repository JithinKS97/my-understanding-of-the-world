# Origin of Languages

1. Humans communicate complex ideas through intricate sound patterns, which has enhanced their ability to create and communicate detailed models of the world.
2. Over time, they began using symbols as a means to communicate, record information, and preserve knowledge.
3. This advancement in communication allowed groups of humans to collaboratively manipulate natural forces and develop the technologies that underpin modern society.
4. This also gave them a better way to store and communicate the simulations of the world.
5. A specific form of symbol manipulation called mathematics was invented, that allowed them to very precisely model the world and that gave them the ability to manipulate nature's forces in precise ways.
